## Contributing
Have a look at [community/Corruptor-sample](community/Corruptor-sample) to see a sample folder. Your car should have this same folder structure. Include README.md in your vehicle folder, along with an image (and add the image to the README.md).

Once you've got your folder laid out ready for upload, here's how you can add it to the repo:

1. Download and install [git](https://git-scm.com/) if you don't already have it.
3. Fork the repo by clicking the Fork button in the top right corner (when logged in to github).
2. Clone the new repo.
   * Windows:
     1. Open any folder in explorer.
	 2. Hold shift and right-click any empty part of the folder.
	 3. Hit either "Open PowerShell window here" or "Open command window here" depending on your version of Windows.
	 4. Type in `git clone https://github.com/Californ1a/custom-cars.git` and hit enter.
     <!--* Mac-->
	 <!--* Linux-->
3. Place your vehicle folder inside the community directory.
